// Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
// The app should then prompt users with two messages
// The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
// The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
// Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
// If not, the app should log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.
// However, if your store does have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.
// This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
// Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
